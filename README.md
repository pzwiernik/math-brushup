  This intensive course reviews key tools in calculus and linear algebra that will be essential for success in the Masterâ€™s programs in Economics and Finance.  
  Because we cover a large amount of material in a short period, the pace is demanding. Students are encouraged to use the course strategically: it provides an opportunity to refresh fundamental concepts, to identify personal gaps in mathematical background, and to establish good study habits before the start of the program.
